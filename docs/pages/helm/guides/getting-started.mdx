title: Getting started with the Teleport Helm chart repository
description: How to install and configure the Gravitational Teleport Helm chart repository
---

This guide will get you started with being able to set up Teleport using our official Helm charts.

## Installing Helm

Teleport's charts require the use of Helm version 3. You can [install Helm 3 by following these instructions](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).

Throughout this guide, we will assume that you have the `helm` binary available in your `PATH`:

```shell
helm version
```

## Adding the Teleport Helm chart repository

To allow Helm to install charts which are hosted in the Teleport Helm repository, use `helm repo add`:

```shell
helm repo add teleport https://charts.releases.teleport.dev
```

Once installed, you can search repositories for charts using the `helm search repo` command:

```shell
helm search repo teleport
```

To update the cache of charts from the remote repository, run `helm repo update`:

```shell
helm repo update
```

## Teleport Charts hosted by the repository

The Teleport Helm repository hosts two Helm charts:

- [`teleport-cluster`](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/tree/master/examples/chart/teleport-cluster)
- [`teleport-kube-agent`](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/tree/master/examples/chart/teleport-kube-agent)

### teleport-cluster

The `teleport-cluster` Helm chart is used to configure a Teleport cluster. It runs two Teleport services:

| Teleport service | Purpose | Documentation |
| - | - | - |
| `auth_service` | Authenticates users and hosts, and issues certificates | [Auth documentation](../../architecture/authentication.mdx)
| `proxy_service`| Runs the externally-facing parts of a Teleport cluster, such as the web UI, SSH proxy and reverse tunnel service | [Proxy documentation](../../architecture/proxy.mdx) |

The `teleport-cluster` chart can be deployed in four different modes. We provide a detailed guide for each mode:

| `chartMode` | Guide |
| - | - |
| `standalone` | [Running a quick one-pod Teleport cluster in Kubernetes using Helm](./standalone.mdx) |
| `aws` | [Running a highly-available Teleport cluster using AWS, EKS and Helm](./aws.mdx) |
| `gcp` | [Running a highly-available Teleport cluster using GCP, GKE and Helm](./gcp.mdx) |
| `ownconfig` | [Running a Teleport cluster with a custom Teleport config using Helm](./ownconfig.mdx) |

Please continue using one of these guides to set up your Teleport cluster using Helm.

For advanced users: [Detailed `teleport-cluster` chart reference](./teleport-cluster-reference.mdx)

### teleport-kube-agent

The `teleport-kube-agent` Helm chart is used to configure a Teleport agent which runs in a remote Kubernetes cluster and joins back to a
Teleport cluster to provide access to services running there.

The `teleport-kube-agent` chart can run any or all of three Teleport services:

| Teleport service | Name for `roles` and `tctl tokens add` | Purpose |
| - | - | - |
| [`kubernetes_service`](../../kubernetes-access/guides.mdx) | `kube` | Uses Teleport to handle authentication with and proxy access to a Kubernetes cluster |
| [`application_service`](../../application-access/guides.mdx) | `app` | Uses Teleport to handle authentication with and proxy access to web-based applications |
| [`database_service`](../../database-access/guides.mdx) | `db` | Uses Teleport to handle authentication with and proxy access to databases |

Please click the links above for guides detailing how each mode might be used.
