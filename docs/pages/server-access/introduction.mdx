# Server Access

Teleport Server Access is designed for the following scenarios:

1. When SSH is required (Teleport Node or SSH mode), not just Teleport certificate authority (Teleport Auth) with proxy (Teleport Proxy) mode.
2. When resource and network security absolutely must be maximized - SSH certificates over secret keys, Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), Single Sign-On (SSO), and short-lived certificates.
3. When up to a vast number of clusters must be managed either using the command-line (`tsh`) or programmatically (through the Teleport API).
4. When it's important to track and audit every user session.

Key features provided by Teleport Server Access:

1. **Built-in server authentication**: Teleport Server Access allows full SSH management without third-party dependencies. [Reduce the likelihood of a dependency or tool vulnerability](https://www.cse.usf.edu/~xou/publications/esorics08.pdf) by limiting the number of vendors.
2. **Teleport Server Access provides full SSH capabilities combined with support for 2FA, OAuth 2.0, Open ID Connect, SAML, and SSO out-of-the-box**.
3. The Teleport SSH daemon also offers **several advantages over other SSH alternatives** including [*cluster introspection*](https://goteleport.com/blog/openssh-vs-teleport/), built-in Role-Based Access Control, Two-Factor Authentication, and multi-user sessions.
4. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: built-in support for delegating permissions and access by the *Principle of Least Privilege* (POLP).
5. **A convenient web UI** for easily representing and interacting with resources and user sessions.
6. **Multi-cluster management through a clean user interface and API**: there's no need to live in Command-Line Hell when managing your many devices.
7. Single and multi-user **session auditing and recording**.
