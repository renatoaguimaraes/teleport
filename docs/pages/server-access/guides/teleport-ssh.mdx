# Teleport SSH

Teleport Server Access provides full SSH capabilities out-of-the-box:

1. Teleport's `tsh` combines support for SSH and SCP in one convenient local command-line tool.
2. Each Teleport node can be configured into SSH mode (Teleport Node) and run as an enhanced SSH server.

These features can be run without using third-party tools like OpenSSH allowing admins to reduce the complexity of their stack. In short, Teleport is a full-fledged SSH server with advanced capabilities no other SSH alternative currently has.

## Introduction to Teleport SSH capabilities

Teleport Server Access provides many great features to manage your servers and permissions:

1. **Built-in server authentication**: Teleport Server Access allows full SSH management without third-party dependencies. [Reduce the likelihood of a tool or dependency vulnerability](https://www.cse.usf.edu/~xou/publications/esorics08.pdf) by limiting the number of vendors.
2. **Teleport Server Access provides full SSH capabilities combined with support for 2FA, OAuth 2.0, Open ID Connect, SAML, and SSO out-of-the-box**.
3. The Teleport SSH daemon also offers **several advantages over other SSH alternatives** including [*cluster introspection*](https://goteleport.com/blog/openssh-vs-teleport/), built-in Role-Based Access Control, Two-Factor Authentication, and multi-user sessions.
4. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: built-in support for delegating permission and access by the *Principle of Least Privilege* (POLP).
5. **A convenient web UI** for easily representing and interacting with resources and user sessions.
6. **Multi-cluster management through a graphical user interface or API**: there's no need to live in Command-Line Hell when managing your many devices.
7. Single and multi-user **session auditing and recording**.

## SSH mode and adding an SSH Node to your cluster

Teleport [Nodes](../../architecture/nodes.mdx) have three modes: *Auth*, *Proxy*, and *Node* (SSH) mode. A single Node can run in up to all three. Optionally, you can configure a Node to act as the dedicated *Auth* or SSH Node for a cluster.

The two primary ways a Node can be configured into SSH (or any) mode is through a `teleport.yaml` configuration file or via the `sudo tctl tokens add` command which accepts the `--type` parameter to specify which of `auth`, `proxy`, or `node` (default) the Node will be automatically configured as.

In both cases, you'll likely use a *static* (fixed) or *dynamic* (valid for a limited duration of time) *join token* to link your Nodes to existing clusters.

To link an SSH Node with an existing `auth.example.com` cluster:

1. Execute `sudo tctl tokens add --type=node` on the `auth` cluster machine.

2. You should see:

   ```bash
   # Join cluster
   sudo teleport start \
      --roles=node \
      --token=d62629ea83e181644e0778af22ec3a8e \
      --ca-pin=sha256:c75f8be5b21a5cc1b6f91a71200f30a9a083dfea4fc47ec1c55143ccce8882e4 \
      --auth-server=172.31.17.124:3025
   ```

   <Admonition type="warning">
      Remember to replace the IP address supplied by default above with the `auth.example.com` proxy address: `auth.example.com:443`.
   </Admonition>

3. Run the command above with the correct `auth.example.com` public proxy address on the machine you wish to connect.

4. You should now be able to view both Nodes at: `https://auth.example.com/web/cluster/auth.example.com/nodes` in the Web Interface after logging in with your the user `auth-admin`.

## Connect to a cluster using tsh ssh without OpenSSH

Teleport SSH is robust enough that you can do all the things you'd do with OpenSSH, without it.

To connect to a cluster (`auth.example.com`) with public proxy `auth.example.com:443` as user `auth-admin` using `tsh ssh`:

1. `tsh login --proxy=auth.example.com:443 --user=auth-admin`  

2. You'll be prompted to for the password and One Time Pass code we set up previously.

3. Your user will now see:

   ```bash
   Profile URL:        https://auth.example.com:443
     Logged in as:       auth-admin
     Cluster:            auth.example.com
     Roles:              access, admin, editor
     Logins:             root, ubuntu, ec2-user
     Kubernetes:         disabled
     Valid until:        2021-04-30 06:39:13 -0500 CDT [valid for 12h0m0s]
     Extensions:         permit-agent-forwarding, permit-port-forwarding, permit-pty
   ```

   `auth-admin` is now logged into the `auth.example.com` cluster and `auth` Node via Teleport SSH - no third-party tool required.

4. `auth-admin` can now execute the following to find the cluster's `nodenames` which are used for direct SSH connections:

   i. `tctl nodes ls`  
   ii. The `auth` node is located on the bottom line below:

   ```bash
   Nodename         UUID                                 Address        Labels                                
   ---------------- ------------------------------------ -------------- ------------------------------------- 
   ip-172-31-30-155 8f1e2719-3161-400f-b664-3279cf046511                env=example,hostname=ip-172-31-30-155 
   ip-172-31-17-124 e7719967-b6eb-4fc0-8e53-00fac6d896d4 127.0.0.1:3022 env=example,hostname=ip-172-31-17-124 
   ```

5. Using the command `tsh ssh root@ip-172-31-17-124` locally, `auth-admin` can SSH into the `auth` Node and do the following:

   i. Connect to other Nodes in the cluster by repeating the steps above.  
   ii. Traverse the Linux file system.  
   iii. Execute desired commands.  

   - The `tsh ssh` command allows one to do anything they would if they were to SSH into a server using a third-party tool. 
   - All commands executed by `auth-admin` are recorded and can be replayed in the Teleport Web interface.

## Configure Single Sign-On

Teleport Server Access supports Single Sign-On (SSO) for authenticating users when they log into Teleport Web UI and through `tsh`. 

- GitHub SSO is described [here](../getting-started.mdx#step-3a-set-up-github-sso)
- Gitlab SSO [here](../../enterprise/sso/gitlab.mdx)
- Okta SSO [here](../../enterprise/sso/ssh-okta.mdx)
- [Open ID Connect](../../enterprise/sso/oidc.mdx)
- And [many more](../../enterprise/sso/ssh-sso.mdx)

## Audit user and SSH sessions

Teleport Server Access has built-in [session auditing](../../features/enhanced-session-recording.mdx) that will record single and joint user interactions.

- When a user authenticates and performs commands through `tsh ssh`, their activities are recorded in replayable session videos that can be viewed in Teleport Web UI.

## Inspect and manage the cluster 

Teleport `tctl` (tea-kettle) has powerful querying and multi-command capabilities to make inspecting and managing a cluster even easier.

1. Teleport admins can define `labels` for any Node to easily group resources beyond cluster management.

2. These [labels](../../admin-guide.mdx#labeling-nodes-and-applications) can be used to query any resource sharing them: 

   - `tsh ssh root@env=example` returns the list of all resources with the `env=example` label specified in their `teleport.yaml` (`'env': 'example'`).

Suppose an IP address changes. An admin can quickly find the current Node with that label since it remains unchanged.

Suppose you need to query the SSH Node of each cluster. Give each SSH Node the same label so a single query will allow you to inspect specific resources in multiple clusters.

## Configure short-lived certificates for access

Teleport Server Access provides the ability to manage short-lived certificates and give users API and resource access for specified durations of time:

1. Users can define a role to programmatically interact with the Teleport API per the [Teleport API Getting Started](../../reference/api/introduction.mdx).

   - This is designed to be convenient for mass deployments or operations that must be repeated (daily jobs, frequent operations, etc.)

2. Admins also create short-lived certificates for resources users must connect to directly:

   - Execute: `tctl auth sign --ttl=87600h --user=jenkins --out=jenkins.pem` to generate a certificate valid for a specified *Time To Live* (TTL).
   - Team members can access private resources securely using certificates and SSH tunnels.
   - No sharing of resource secrets, passwords, or credentials only certificates that are unique to that user and specified period of time.
